 RECURSION
=============
---
## What is recursion?
	Recursion is a method where the solution to a problem depends on the solution to the smaller instance of the same problem

### How to implement recursion?

- Identify the base case: The base case is the simplest form of the problem that can be solved directly without any further recursive calls. It serves as the termination condition for the recursion. Determine the conditions under which the function should stop calling itself.

-  Handle the base case: Inside the recursive function, check if the base case condition is met. If it is, return the result or perform any necessary actions for the base case.

- Break down the problem: If the base case condition is not met, break down the problem into smaller subproblems that can be solved by calling the recursive function. Modify the parameters to represent the new state of the problem.

- Make the recursive call: Call the recursive function, passing the modified parameters to solve the subproblem(s). The function will execute again from the beginning, but with a different state.

- Combine the results: Once the recursive function returns a result for the subproblem(s), combine them to obtain the solution for the original problem.

- Return the final result: Return the final result of the original problem from the recursive function.

*It's important to note that recursion requires careful consideration of the base case and the progression towards it. If the base case is not reached or not properly defined, the recursive function may end up in an infinite loop.*

*Also, be mindful of the performance implications of recursion, as it can consume a significant amount of memory and stack space for deeply nested recursive calls. Some problems can be solved more efficiently using iterative approaches instead of recursion.*

*Remember to check the specific syntax and rules of the programming language you are using, as recursion may have language-specific requirements or limitations.*
### In what situation should you implement recursion?
Recursion is commonly used in the following situations:

- Problems that can be naturally divided into smaller subproblems, such as searching and sorting algorithms.
- Tree and graph traversal algorithms, where each node can be treated as a smaller subproblem.
- Problems that exhibit self-similarity, where the solution to the larger problem can be obtained by solving smaller instances of the same problem.
- Backtracking and combinatorial problems, where recursive calls explore different possibilities or combinations.
- Mathematical problems that involve recursive definitions or formulas, such as Fibonacci sequence or factorial calculations.
- Divide-and-conquer algorithms, where the problem is divided into smaller parts, solved recursively, and then combined to obtain the final result.
- Problems involving recursive data structures, such as linked lists or binary trees, where recursion can simplify the manipulation or traversal of the structure.

### In what sitution should you not implement recursion?
Here are situations where you generally shouldn't implement recursion:

- When the problem can be solved more efficiently using an iterative approach.
- When the depth of recursion is too large, leading to stack overflow errors or excessive memory usage.
- When the problem does not naturally lend itself to recursive decomposition or subproblem solving.
- When the overhead of function calls and stack management outweighs the benefits of using recursion.
- When the problem requires sequential or iterative processing rather than recursive exploration.
- When the problem involves mutable state or side effects that are difficult to manage with recursion.
- When the programming language or environment has limitations or performance issues with recursion.
