# RECURSION

## What is recursion?
	Recursion is a method where the solution to a problem depends on the solution to the smaller instance of the same problem

### How to implement recursion?

- Identify the base case: The base case is the simplest form of the problem that can be solved directly without any further recursive calls. It serves as the termination condition for the recursion. Determine the conditions under which the function should stop calling itself.

-  Define the recursive function: Create a function that will call itself to solve the problem. The function should take appropriate parameters to represent the current state of the problem.

-  Handle the base case: Inside the recursive function, check if the base case condition is met. If it is, return the result or perform any necessary actions for the base case.

- Break down the problem: If the base case condition is not met, break down the problem into smaller subproblems that can be solved by calling the recursive function. Modify the parameters to represent the new state of the problem.

- Make the recursive call: Call the recursive function, passing the modified parameters to solve the subproblem(s). The function will execute again from the beginning, but with a different state.

- Combine the results: Once the recursive function returns a result for the subproblem(s), combine them to obtain the solution for the original problem.

- Return the final result: Return the final result of the original problem from the recursive function.

_It's important to note that recursion requires careful consideration of the base case and the progression towards it. If the base case is not reached or not properly defined, the recursive function may end up in an infinite loop.

Also, be mindful of the performance implications of recursion, as it can consume a significant amount of memory and stack space for deeply nested recursive calls. Some problems can be solved more efficiently using iterative approaches instead of recursion.

Remember to check the specific syntax and rules of the programming language you are using, as recursion may have language-specific requirements or limitations._
